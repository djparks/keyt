Test keystore resources

- sample.jks: JKS keystore with one trusted certificate alias 'trusted'. Password: changeit
- sample.p12: PKCS12 keystore with the same content. Password: changeit

Note: Binary keystore files are typically generated; if these files are missing, regenerate locally using the test setup or keytool.
